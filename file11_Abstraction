//points to remember 
//1. abstract class must be decalred with an abstract keyword
//2. it can have abstract as well as non-abstract methods
//3. it cannot be instantiated.
//4. it can have constructor and static methods also
//5. it can have final methods which will force the subclass not to change the body of the method
